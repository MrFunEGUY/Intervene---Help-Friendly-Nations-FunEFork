[h1]Short Description:[/h1]

- This mod grants all empires an edict that allows them to enter into wars being waged by their allies. For the purposes of this mod, an ally is anyone with a positive opinion ( > 0 ) of your empire.

- In a Federation, only the Federation leader can suggest joining an ally's war.

[h1]Changes From Original:[/h1]

- Does not require Diplomacy tradition to be adopted.

- One year wait time between interventions as opposed to 5.

- Interventions start at 120 Influence, and increase in cost every intervention you have within a 15 year period. For the price to reset, wait 15 years between interventions.

- If your ally is engaged in multiple wars, you must specify which war you want to join.

- Various English localization changes.

- Allies whose wars you join will get a +150 opinion modifier from you that decays -3 / year, so it will completely decay 50 years after the you enter the war.

[h1]Notes:[/h1]

- Right now, this can be used to get around the 10-year truces. This may be fixed in the future.

- The AI had been coded to be able to use the edict, but it seems like they will always use it if they can, so I'm taking their ability to use it away for now until I figure out how to make it more random.

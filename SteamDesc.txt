[h1]Short Description:[/h1]

- This mod grants all empires an edict that allows them to enter into wars being waged by their allies. For the purposes of this mod, an ally is anyone with a positive opinion ( > 0 ) of your empire.

- If in a Federation, only the Federation leader can suggest joining an ally's war.

[h1]Changes From Original:[/h1]

- Does not require Diplomacy tradition to be adopted.

- One year wait time between interventions as opposed to 5.

- Interventions cost 200 influence.

- You can pick which war you want to join, if your ally is engaged in multiple wars.

- Various English localization changes.

- Allies whose wars you join will get a +150 opinion modifier from you that decays -3 / year, so it will completely decay 50 years after the you enter the war.

[h1]Support:[/h1]

- Full support for Zenith of Fallen Empires

- Support for new AI personalities added by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701432146]More AI Personalities[/url]

- For the additional personalities where it made sense, I've made it so the AI should occasionally use the edict and join allied wars.

[h1]Notes:[/h1]

- Right now, this can be used to get around the 10-year truces. This may be fixed in the future.

- The AI had been coded to be able to use the edict, but it seems like they will always use it if they can, so I'm taking their ability to use it away for now until I figure out how to make it more random.
